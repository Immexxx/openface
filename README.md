#Quickstart


***********************************
docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 -m 2g -c 2048 -t -i bamos/openface /bin/bash

cd /root/openface/

./data/download-lfw-subset.sh

apt-get update 

apt-get install vim 

***********************************


Setup: This Dockerfile has the "setup" 

On OpenFace, the setup instructions point to Dockerhub - which has the contents of this file. 

This Dockerfile uses a prebuilt image with OpenCV, DLib, Torch. On top of that image, it pulls in more things. 

To start with, create a Docker image with this Docker file and see where it takes you! 

#git clone "this repo" (#git clone https://github.com/Immexxx/openface.git) 

(To build the Docker image - use the following command. Tip: looks like this takes a long time) 

#docker build -t openface .

*Item 1

(Alternatively, try - takes about ~ 10-15 mins for the build to complete) 

#docker pull bamos/openface  

($docker images - will show: )

bamos/openface                                                      latest              4a661a4cae83        3 days ago          1.941 GB

Jump into that Docker image: 

*Item 2


NEW: $docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 -m 2g -c 2048 -t -i bamos/openface  /bin/bash


OLD: $docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 -t -i bamos/openface  /bin/bash



From: https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/setup/

$cd /root/openface
$ ./data/download-lfw-subset.sh (Get test data) 

*Item 3 

$./run-tests.sh ( 7 tests. 3 Failures - as there was not data. Need to download data:$ ./data/download-lfw-subset.sh) 

(This will take ~ 42 mins on a Macbook Pro)

*Item 4

$./demos/compare.py images/examples/{lennon*,clapton*} //Compares two images. Results look like: 

Comparing images/examples/lennon-1.jpg with images/examples/lennon-2.jpg.
  + Squared l2 distance between representations: 0.763
Comparing images/examples/lennon-1.jpg with images/examples/clapton-1.jpg.
  + Squared l2 distance between representations: 1.132
  .....

Code: https://github.com/Immexxx/openface/blob/master/demos/compare.py

See: https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/demo-2-comparison/ for more info.

  
*Item 5 

$./demos/classifier.py infer models/openface/celeb-classifier.nn4.small2.v1.pkl ./images/examples/adams.jpg 

/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/sklearn/lda.py:4: DeprecationWarning: lda.LDA has been moved to discriminant_analysis.LinearDiscriminantAnalysis in 0.17 and will be removed in 0.19
  "in 0.17 and will be removed in 0.19", DeprecationWarning)

=== ./images/examples/adams.jpg ===
Predict AmyAdams with 0.81 confidence.

For carell.jpg: 

=== ./images/examples/carell.jpg ===
Predict SteveCarell with 0.97 confidence.

Code: https://github.com/Immexxx/openface/blob/master/demos/classifier.py

This "mode" does the infering and not the training. Running "infer" on the pic adams.jgp

See: https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/demo-3-classifier/ for more information. 

*Item 6 

$./demos/web/start-servers.sh 

Run the command above. Go to your browser, URL: http://localhost:8000 

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZJOTRkjZA4 for instructions


****************************************
(Quick Start - already there. Remove this?) 

docker run -p 9000:9000 -p 8000:8000 -m 3g -c 2048 -t -i bamos/openface /bin/bash

docker exec -it aec81600c5cd  /bin/bash

=> Build your own docker image (with VIM). Use that instead! Start in the night and get it done!
